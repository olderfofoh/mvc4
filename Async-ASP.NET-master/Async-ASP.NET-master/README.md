Async-ASP.NET
=============

ASP.NET MVC 4/RC, Web Forms and Web API Asynchronous samples.
You must first build the WebAPI application. The Web API app serves data for both the MVC and the Web Forms projects.
See WebAPI\WebAPIpgw\Notes.html

For the MVC Application, see Mvc4Async\Mvc4Async\mvc4async_setup.html

For Web Forms, instructions are a work in progress.
